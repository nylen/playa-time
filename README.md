## What?

Proposal for Burning Man 2017 art project.

A metal and acrylic sculpture with acrylic panels that will be able to swing in
the wind.  The panels will be connected to sensors that will drive
individually-controlled RGB LEDs mounted around the edge of each panel, shining
inwards.  The LEDs will move in patterns that evoke a feeling of "flowing" with
the wind and the dust.
